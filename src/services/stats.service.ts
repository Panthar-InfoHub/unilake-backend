// Aggregation behind the admin overview dashboard.
//
// Three exported functions, one per endpoint, deliberately NOT merged into a
// single "getEverything" call: the overview loads them as three independent
// TanStack queries so the ops-triage band paints without waiting on the chart,
// and one failing aggregate cannot blank the whole page.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ONE RULE THAT RUNS THROUGH THIS FILE
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// `range` filters MONEY AND VOLUME ONLY. Status counts, the needs-attention
// numbers and the recent-orders list are always live snapshots of right now.
//
// "₹48,500 in the last 30 days" is a statement about a period. "5 orders
// awaiting dimensions" is a statement about this moment — range-filtering it
// would hide a 40-day-old order that still has to be packed, which is exactly
// the order someone needs to be told about.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// NOTE ON PRISMA FEATURES
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file introduces `groupBy`, aggregate `_sum`/`_count` and `$queryRaw` to
// a codebase that previously used none of them (only relation `_count`). The
// two raw queries exist for reasons that are structural, not stylistic:
//   - the chart needs day/month bucketing, which `groupBy` cannot express;
//   - `Order` has no `comicId` (it lives on `OrderSession`), so ranking comics
//     by order volume needs a real join.
// Everything else stays in the query builder.
